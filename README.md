# chocolatey-install
This action sets up a [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) build package named `gh` and adds it to the PATH. It's pretty simple as possible, and can be used in case you want to build a Windows app. If successful, the `gh` package can now be used with subsequent workflow steps. (This action has a critical rate of successfully completing.) This workflow only takes **fourteen seconds to âœ…finish**! By using this workflow, you agree to the license of the `gh` Chocolatey package.
